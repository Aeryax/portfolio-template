## What is a starter ?
As a web developer you often have to start a new project. I think it's quite boring to restart a project from scratch so I made this repository to quickly start on a clean base.

## What is included in the package ?
- [Gulp 4](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
- [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/)

## Reduce work time and effort
- Test: Karma runner and jasmine/protractor framework.
- Code: Live-reload with Browser-Sync.
- Documentation: Generate changelog, TODOlist, website documentation...
